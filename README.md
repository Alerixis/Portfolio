**James M's Public Portfolio** 

Hello! Thank you for visiting my personal working portfolio. I will be adding to this portfolio as time progresses to show off what I have done and what I continue to learn. Most of these folders contain various class projects and some personal projects as well.

Any of the projects save for the TrigonometricAssemblyCalculator and the TankProjectScripts contain Makefiles or are easy to run with a simple command. It should be simple to pull those down and run them with any of the included test scripts in Linux. 

**AVLTreeProject: C++** 

The goal was to piece together AVL Tree of different types. Its success was denoted by sentences being placed in the correct order in the way the nodes were fed into each of the trees. This was a project contained in my Data Structures course.
    
    Run this project by using:
        make
        a.out <inputfile>
        
 **Buffy Simulator: C++**
 
 This was an interesting project detailing the interactions between many different objects all represented by characters in a PC driven simulation.
(Buffy, Redshirts, Human, Zombies, etc.) The interactions are set to a random seed and plays through with a special ruleset. Inheritence and Polymorphism were important aspects covered in this project.

    Run this project by using:
        make
        Game

**The Connect 4 Lookahead AI: Python**

This project consists of an Connect 4 game board being played by two competing AI players. The "input.txt" file is the gameboard shown in ASCII values. Please change this to whatever game state youd like when pulling it down. This will make the game play out differently until I implement some more randomness within the program. I also plan to leave one AI and allow a human player to connect with this as well. 

    Run this project by using:
        python Play.py input.txt <Optional: lookahead integer>  //For 3 or greater, prepare to wait.

**The Cuckoo Hash Table: C++**

This project was a small group research project utilizing hash tables. Each person was assigned a different rule set to test different forms of hashing. 
 
    Run this project by using:
           make
           driver <InputFile> 
           
 **The Tank Project: C# with Unity Game Engine**

This was a personal learning project utilizing the Unity Game Engine. The scripts control a 3D Tank Shooter where the player has an "Over-the-shoulder" camera view of a desert base. There are turrets that are placed around that aim towards the player shooting explosives to destroy their tank. This game includes, power-ups, reload sequences, automated enemy scripts, and particle effect systems. Once I have a way to host the game, I will place the url here. For now, here are the scripts.
 
 **The Trigonometric Assembly Calculator: ARM Assembly**
 
 This was the final project for my Computer Architecture course. It was a particularly challenging assembly program to work through. It is able to take Sin, Cos, Tan values from range 0-90 and calculates sinh, cosh,tanh,and e^x from the ranges 0 - 9 (though could be expanded). However, it does not utilize any MUL operations. This helps to keep the instruction counts low in the CPU in order to keep it quite fast. You can download the ARMSim simulator to test this code as a ".s" file.
